- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ganu-docs
- 👀 I’m interested in contributing by writing and reviewing documentation for projects. I have experience in creating PRs and collaborating through them. I have also used GitHub Desktop for 3 years at my workplace.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to review and also write content. I am a technical writer and I have been writing and reviewing content for the past 12 years. It has been my dream to work on open source projects. I want to learn more. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different types of documents.
- 📫 You can reach me at ganeshrcblover@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once learned sign language (Pin Man's symbols) just to chat with my friend at school.
